## About:
<p>Small project developed at the beginning of the <b>Web Development Fundamentals module</b> at Trybe.</p>
<p>The goal was to create a pixel-art board, where users could select colors from random-generated ones and click on a blank square to paint it.</p>
<p>Additionally, there is an option for users to generate new random colors, change the size of the board, and erase a click with a middle-button click.</p>
<p>It was made using <b>HTML</b>, <b>CSS</b> and <b>Javascript</b>.</p>
